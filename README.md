This is a school project which attempts to build a pipeline that converts mathematical handwriting to Latex using the proprietary model from the work of Francisco Álvaro, Joan-Andreu Sánchez and José-Miguel Benedí. The Latex file will then be processed via Mathematica to performing autograding.

The math expression recognition model is described in:
* Francisco Álvaro, Joan-Andreu Sánchez and José-Miguel Benedí. An Integrated Grammar-based Approach for Mathematical Expression Recognition. Pattern Recognition, pp. 135-147, 2016

Installation and how to use:
1. Download it as zip file or clone
2. Open main.py. Run main.py with the example xopp files in the Input folder.

Other conversion tools to try:

1. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270584254_ICFHR_2014_Competition_on_Recognition_of_On-line_Handwritten_Mathematical_Expressions_CROHME_2014
2. Infty reader https://www.sciaccess.net/en/InftyReader/index.html (only works
on pdf, not handwritten)
3. Since the Windows input panel is so good, why don't we work from there?
