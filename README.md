# UROPS2020

This is a school project which attempts to build a pipeline that converts mathematical handwriting to Latex using the properitory model from the work of Francisco Álvaro, Joan-Andreu Sánchez and José-Miguel Benedí. The Latex file will then be processed via Mathematica to performing autograding.

The math expression recognition model is described in:
* Francisco Álvaro, Joan-Andreu Sánchez and José-Miguel Benedí. An Integrated Grammar-based Approach for Mathematical Expression Recognition. Pattern Recognition, pp. 135-147, 2016

Installation and how to use:
1. Download it as zip file or clone
2. Open DocumentClass.py and NewPageClass.py. Change all root path directory to adjust for you own local use. (i.e. (your own path)/UROPS2020/....) 
3. Open main.py. There is an example file in the Input folder. Run main.py
4. A Latex file will be generated in the Latex folder.
